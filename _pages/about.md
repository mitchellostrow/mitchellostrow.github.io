I'm a 3rd year PhD student at MIT. I'm interested in bridging systems neuroscience, cognitive science, and deep learning through the lens of dynamical systems theory and machine learning. To that end, I design and use quantitative methods to understand computations performed by both biological and artificial neural networks. I've worked in medicine (as an EMT), experimental neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (in industry). 

I also work as a freelance editor, especially for college admission essays and graduate school statements of purpose, but I can edit both technical and non-technical pieces more generally. Feel free to reach out to me at \[last-name\] (at) mit.edu if you're interested. 

I'm grateful to have been supported at MIT by the Computationally-Enabled Integrative Neuroscience Fellowship and the Praecis Presidential Fellowship. I'm currently supported by the NSF GRFP.

[Simply Neuroscience](https://simplyneuroscience.org/) interviewed me on their podcast, The Synapse, about doing neuroscience research at Yale. Link [here](https://anchor.fm/the-synapse/episodes/The-College-Neuro-Network-Yale-University-from-an-Undergraduate-Student-ehsf7e).
