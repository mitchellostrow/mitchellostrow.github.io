I seek to bridge the gaps between nervous systems and deep learning by developing a quantitative understanding of how + what the brain 
computes. I design and use methods from statistics, dynamical systems theory, and representation learning to analyze the computations performed by both biological and artificial neural networks. When used as a scientific model, deep neural networks can be used to study brain function in ways beyond contemporary experimental techniques. Through these approaches, I want to design brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems, build brain-machine interfaces, and identify the etiology of psychiatric disorders. I've worked in medicine (as an EMT), experimental neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (in industry). 

I'm fortunate to have been supported at MIT by the Computationally-Enabled Integrative Neuroscience Fellowship and the Praecis Presidential Fellowship. I'm currently supported by the NSF GRFP. 
<!-- I primarily use Python and its data science / ML ecosystem nowadays, but worked extensively with R in undergraduate. I also use Matlab and Julia, on occasion. -->

<!-- Yale Symposia was kind enough to [profile me](https://www.yalesymposia.com/neuroscience-lab-profile/2021/8/24/exploration-a-trait-shared-by-both-music-and-research) and my undergraduate journey in neuroscience research.  -->

[Simply Neuroscience](https://simplyneuroscience.org/) interviewed me on their podcast, The Synapse, about doing neuroscience research at Yale. Link [here](https://anchor.fm/the-synapse/episodes/The-College-Neuro-Network-Yale-University-from-an-Undergraduate-Student-ehsf7e).
