As our brains are the only proof that flexible intelligence can exist, I seek to bridge the gaps 
between nervous systems and deep learning by developing a quantitative understanding of how the brain 
computes. For example, I’m interested in designing learning rules and architectures for deep networks based on the nervous system’s structure. 
Given the (abstract) similarities in biological and artificial neural data due to their hierarchical, parallel, nonlinear processing, 
a neuroscientific analysis of deep neural networks could provide insight into their function. This translates 
back to neuroscience when they are used as a scientific model. To that end, I seek to design novel 
quantitative tools from machine learning, dynamical systems theory and representation learning to analyze the computations 
performed by both biological and artificial neural networks. 

I've worked in medicine (as an EMT), experimental neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (in industry). I envision utilizing computation beyond basic neuroscience to build brain-machine interfaces, develop novel brain-inspired AI algorithms, and identify the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

I primarily use Python and its data science / ML ecosystem nowadays, but worked extensively with R in undergraduate. I also use Matlab and Julia, on occasion.

Yale Symposia was kind enough to [profile me](https://www.yalesymposia.com/neuroscience-lab-profile/2021/8/24/exploration-a-trait-shared-by-both-music-and-research) and my undergraduate journey in neuroscience research. 

[Simply Neuroscience](https://simplyneuroscience.org/) interviewed me on their podcast, The Synapse, about doing neuroscience research at Yale. Link [here](https://anchor.fm/the-synapse/episodes/The-College-Neuro-Network-Yale-University-from-an-Undergraduate-Student-ehsf7e).
