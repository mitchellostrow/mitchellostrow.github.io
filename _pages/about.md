My goal is to work at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning, developing algorithms 
both as theoretical models of neural computation and as tools to analyze neural activity. In particular, I 
want to leverage computation to understand how cognition emerges from biological and artificial neural 
networks. 

As our brains are the only proof that flexible intelligence can exist, I seek to bridge the gaps 
between nervous systems and deep learning by developing a quantitative understanding of how the brain 
computes. This research program has been termed a “virtuous cycle” between the fields of neuroscience 
and artificial intelligence, and I plan to contribute to both. For example, I’m interested in designing 
learning rules and architectures for deep networks based on the nervous system’s structure. Given the 
similarities in biological and artificial neural data due to their hierarchical, parallel, nonlinear processing, 
a neuroscientific analysis of deep neural networks could provide insight into their function. This translates 
back to neuroscience when they are used as a scientific model. To that end, I seek to design novel 
quantitative tools from dynamical systems theory and representation learning to analyze the computations 
performed by neural networks. 

I've worked in medicine (as an EMT), basic neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence in industry. I envision utilizing computation beyond basic neuroscience to build brain-machine interfaces, 
develop novel brain-inspired AI algorithms, and identify the etiology of psychiatric disorders

Yale Symposia was kind enough to [profile me](https://www.yalesymposia.com/neuroscience-lab-profile/2021/8/24/exploration-a-trait-shared-by-both-music-and-research) and my undergraduate journey in neuroscience research. 

[Simply Neuroscience](https://simplyneuroscience.org/) interviewed me on their podcast, The Synapse, about doing neuroscience research at Yale. Link [here](https://anchor.fm/the-synapse/episodes/The-College-Neuro-Network-Yale-University-from-an-Undergraduate-Student-ehsf7e).
