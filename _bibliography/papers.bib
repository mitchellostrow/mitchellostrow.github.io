  abstract = {The use of an internal model to infer and predict
              others’ mental states and actions, broadly referred to as Theory
              of Mind (ToM), is a fundamental aspect of human social
              intelligence. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how these models
              are used during social interactions, and how they help an agent
              generalize to new contexts. We investigated a putative neural
              mechanism of ToM in a recurrent circuit through the lens of
              an artificial neural network trained with reinforcement learning
              (RL) to play a competitive matching pennies game against
              many algorithmic opponents. The network showed near-optimal
              performance against unseen opponents, indicating that it had
              acquired the capacity to adapt against new strategies online.
              Analysis of recurrent states during play against out-of-trainingdistribution (OOD) opponents in relation to those of withintraining-distribution (WD) opponents revealed two similaritybased mechanisms by which the network might generalize:
              mapping to a known strategy (template matching) or known
              opponent category (interpolation). Even when the network’s
              strategy cannot be explained by template-matching or interpolation, the recurrent activity fell upon the low-dimensional
              manifold of the WD neural activity, suggesting the contribution of
              prior experience with WD opponents. Furthermore, these states
              occupied low-density edges of the WD-manifold, suggesting that
              the network can extrapolate beyond any learned strategy or
              category. Our results suggest that a neural implementation for
              ToM may be a reservoir of learned representations that provide
              the capacity for generalization via flexible access and reuse of
              these stored features.},

  author = {Ostrow, Mitchell},
  abstract = {As modern medicine becomes increasingly personalized, psychiatry lags behind, using poorly-understood drugs and therapies to treat mental disorders. With the advent of methods that capture large quantities of data, such as genome-wide analyses or fMRI, machine learning (ML) approaches have become prominent in neuroscience. This is promising for studying the brain’s function, but perhaps more importantly, these techniques can potentially predict the onset of disorder and treatment response. Experimental approaches that use naive machine learning algorithms have dominated research in computational psychiatry over the past decade. In a critical review and analysis, I argue that biologically realistic approaches will be more effective in clinical practice, and research trends should reflect this. Hybrid models are considered, and a brief case study on major depressive disorder is presented. Finally, I propose a novel four-step approach for the future implementation of computational methods in psychiatric clinics.},
