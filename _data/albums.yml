  review: "Much more experimental than her new album SAYA, this one took a little longer to get into. But there are some truly beautiful songs: Pap Test, SHT, Empathy for Bethany, If there's no Seat in the Sky, and Sadness Residue are my favorites."

  review: "Another excellent combination of electronic and pop music. A friend introduced me to Sevdaliza back in 2018 and I can't get enough. Her recent turn is into reggaeton but this album is the peak of her original sound."

  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/4diOe5MxsDKBVZbqKaoaex?si=uBEerTbeR_CDZgrQVbDd4g"
  review: "One of the few artists I've seen live multiple times. I saw Soffi Tukker in 2022 at Yale and in 2024 at Roadrunner in Boston. They have the perfect blend of pop, EDM, and Brazilian music."

  review: "Maggie Rogers went a little more mainstream with this album, but I don't think that's a problem. It's a comfortable and fun listen. I especially love The Kill and Don't Forget Me, seeing those live was like a dream."

  artist: "Willow"
  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/5jsfwcWxZIPtF5aaWx0mlL?si=jIzNFfZrQ_uNkTLvdw053Q"
  review: "Those who know Willow as Will Smith's daughter will be surprised by this album's depth and complexity of sound. Willow's voice masterfully combined with jazz themes and rhythms blends into a cohesive, albeit too short, album. Symptom of Life is by far my favorite song (and has an impressive time signature of 7/4 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=YxYVEa_urTo)."

  review: "Caroline's breakout album and the album that solidified her as my favorite artist when I saw her in New Haven back in 2021. Yes, she does sound like this live too! Truly an artist in the greatest sense of the word."

  artist: "Bon Iver"
  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/4bJCKmpKgti10f3ltz6LLl?si=su1cVGOpTviucRTmmWFikw"
  review: "I genuinely think that this album changed my conception of what music is and what it can be for. The blend of folk and electronic music is one of the most unique sounds out there. For me, this is an album about lost love and the painful yet carthatic process of moving on. Of note: through 715 - Creeks I fell in love with the vocoder sound. 33 'God' has one of the most moving single lyrics of any song I know: 'These will just be places to me now' is so painful and yet optimistic at the same time."

  artist: "Finneas"
  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/2b7DunZFOVCs0QgiTI1FJW?si=Fvkoy1QjSQ-jIuirAuDQAA"
  review: "Full of heartwrenching melodies and lyrics, Blood Harmony is short but sweet. Finneas is an excellent standalone artist beyond his work with Billie Eilish."

  artist: "Billie Eilish"
  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/7fRrTyKvE4Skh93v97gtcU?si=UBoTsbD4TAeUEuTGVOseIA"
  review: "I became a fan of Billie's when this album came out in 2017. Her original gritty electronic sound with beautiful high-pitched, breathy vocals was so unique and hit me hard. She fleshed this out further and in many ways better in her debut album in 2019, but I go back to this album more often. "

  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/3iSPMfhw4P30tFrROrbkFm?si=D3mIgveoQYi4BJD0pwB0sA"
  review: "Ethel Cain's style has always been unique, combining multiple genres, and it shines here. Nettles is by far my favorite but the combo of Tempest and Waco, Texas to end this album is unbelievable--25 minutes of hazy, drone-induced melancholy. I am seeing her perform this album in a few weeks and can't be more excited."

  review: "One of the coolest electronic / vocal syntheses I've heard. Her newest album, Choke Enough is just as good, but Galore feels like a more put-together piece of art. Listen front to back!"

  artist: "Banks"
  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/0oXzdlZ9duItTwmJLXbAfo?si=gSdSMBCaSSWJyKQ-RFFBmA"
  review: "Maybe there's a trend here: Banks is one of the coolest artists but there's a lot of variability here. Contaminated is by far the best song and one of my all time favorites."
