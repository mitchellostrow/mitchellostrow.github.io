  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/71XSXeqU8507mW0raHyeUN?si=pQ4VMaknQ4mybbg9IirWlg"
  review: "Much more experimental than her new album SAYA, this one took a little longer to get into. But there are some truly beautiful songs: Pap Test, SHT, Empathy for Bethany, If there's no Seat in the Sky, and Sadness Residue are my favorites."
- title: "Shabrang"

  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/0VtzP3PGH07r1pzwX1CSwq?si=riYzhwCgR-K9qxv9D40NVQ"
  review: "Another excellent combination of electronic and pop music. A friend introduced me to Sevdaliza back in 2018 and I can't get enough. Her recent turn is into reggaeton but this album is the peak of her original sound."

  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/4diOe5MxsDKBVZbqKaoaex?si=uBEerTbeR_CDZgrQVbDd4g"
  review: "One of the few artists I've seen live multiple times. I saw Soffi Tukker in 2022 at Yale and in 2024 at Roadrunner in Boston. They have the perfect blend of pop, EDM, and Brazilian music."

  review: "Maggie Rogers went a little more mainstream with this album, but I don't think that's a problem. It's a comfortable and fun listen. I especially love The Kill and Don't Forget Me, seeing those live was like a dream."

  artist: "Willow"
  spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/album/5jsfwcWxZIPtF5aaWx0mlL?si=jIzNFfZrQ_uNkTLvdw053Q"
  review: "Those who know Willow as Will Smith's daughter will be surprised by this album's depth and complexity of sound. Willow's voice masterfully combined with jazz themes and rhythms blends into a cohesive, albeit too short, album. Symptom of Life is by far my favorite song (and has an impressive time signature of 7/4 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=YxYVEa_urTo)."

  review: "20 years later and I still can't stop listening. I went to see the musical version on Broadway in 2024 and it was the best show I've ever seen. Very sad it's not running anymore."

  review: "Caroline's breakout album and the album that solidified her as my favorite artist when I saw her in New Haven back in 2021. Yes, she does sound like this live too! Truly an artist in the greatest sense of the word."
